Non-standard function not provided in ANSI-C.
          char *  itoa ( int value, char * str, int base );
Converts an integer value to a null-terminated string using the specified base and stores the result in the array given by str parameter.
If base is 10 and value is negative, the resulting string is preceded with a minus sign (-). With any other base, value is always considered unsigned.
str should be an array long enough to contain any possible value.
